k-means clustering with Apache Hadoop

The enlarging volumes of information emerging by the progress of technology, makes clustering of very large scale of data a challenging task. This paper presents a parallel k-means clustering algorithms based on Apache Hadoop MapReduce model which is a simple and powerful parallel programming technique. The tests were performed on intel i7 hexa core in a pseudo-distributed mode and distributed mode with Amazon EMR. The results show that the proposed algorithm can scale well and efficiently process large datasets on commodity hardware.
